### Emitters

Emitters generate particles within given volume and provided direction
spread. Particles themselves have no visual representation and must be
passed to appearance nodes to be seen.

Each particle generated has several initial properties: position,
orientation, motion vector and lifespan. Depending on hierarchy of node
instances defined in effect block particles may or may not inherit
transformation matrix of its emitter (or a completely different node).

-   [Cube](ale-FxCubeEmitter)
-   [Cone](ale-FxConeEmitter)
-   [Sphere](ale-FxSphereEmitter)

### Appearances

Appearances visualize particles that are generated by emitters.

-   [Billboard](ale-FxBasicAppearance)
-   [Dust](ale-FLDustAppearance)
-   [Flat](ale-FxOrientedAppearance)
-   [Effect](ale-FxParticleAppearance)
-   [Mesh](ale-FxMeshAppearance)
-   [Rectangle](ale-FxRectAppearance)
-   [Perpenicular](ale-FxPerpAppearance)
-   [Beam](ale-FLBeamAppearance)

### Fields

Fields can affect position, orientation and motion vector of particles
generated by emitters.

-   [Beam anchor](ale-FLBeamField)
-   [Radial gravity field](ale-FxRadialField)
-   [Directional gravity field](ale-FxGravityField)
-   [Collision surface field](ale-FxCollideField)
-   [Directional air field](ale-FxAirField)
-   [Dust field](ale-FLDustField)
